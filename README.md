# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this project, we used URL for GeoJSON earthquake data, tectonic data and major earthquakes data to retrieve geographical coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then we have visualized the data on a map.

## Objectives:

+ Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
+ Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
+ Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
+ Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
+ Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
+ Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
+ Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
+ Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
+ Render maps on a local server.
